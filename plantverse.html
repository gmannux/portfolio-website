              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                  <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
                  <p>There are a lack of plant shopping apps where users can purchase both real and faux plants, learn how to style plants in their home in addition to learning how to grow their healthy plants.</p>
                  <h3>Solution</h3>
                  <p>Create an app where users can purchase both real plants & faux plants, save their favorite plants, search a look book to see how they can style their plants indoor and outdoor, and learn to care for their own plants at home.</p>

                  <div>
                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
                    <p>To gain insight on creating the best experience for users I set forth to understand who the users are, what their motivations are, and what would motivate users to use Plantverse to purchase their plants over any other apps.</p>
                    <p>I conducted 3-in person interviews from my social circle and received 18 responses to a survey I conducted on users' attitudes towards plant purchasing and maintaining those plants in their homes.
                      Once I had the qualitative and quantitative data I sorted the information using an affinity map to look for patterns. The next step in my process was to personalize this information and create 3 distinct user personas to guide
                      my design process.</p>
                    <h3>Personas</h3>
                    <div id="Plantverse Personas">
                      <picture>
                        <source srcset="img/plantverse/user_persona@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
                        <img src="img/plantverse/user_persona@2x.jpg" alt="Plantverse Personas">
                      </picture>
                    </div>
                    <p>Based on the interviews I set up 3 user personas. I referred to these throughout the entire product development process. The personas helped me set up the solution screens and make the plant searching process quick and easy to save users time.</p>
                    <p>Top 3 User Goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>1. Save plants to favorites or wish-list.</li>
                      <li>2. Find plant inspirations on how to style plant purchases.</li>
                      <li>3. Find plant care details on each product purchased.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> User Task Flow & Analysis </h3>
                    <p>With the user personas goal in mind, I created a simple user flow that takes you through the signup and searching
                      and purchasing a plant through the app. Below is an example of the user Dorian's journey of completing the task based on his goal.</p>

                    <h3>Sketches & Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>I usually start the design process with crazy 8 sketches. This is the way I iterate through many design options quickly. I used 1st and 2nd iteration for each user flow. After evaluating the crazy 8 designs I decided to move on to paper prototypes to further etch out my ideas for this app and to find design solutions for my user flows.</p>
                    <p>I took the sketches from the low fidelity wire-frames and made them digital using Sketch. I would later prototype these sketches to be tested in my usability testing phase using Invision.</p>

                    <h2>User Testing</h2>
                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>The next step in my process was to put together an interactive prototype using Invision. This prototype gave a digital interactive vision to my design that could be shown and tested. I recruited 5 participants in my network to test. These users varied in demographics such as age, employment, education, and location so I could gather the most diverse test pool possible. I created a test plan and script. These tests spanned across 2 days and were moderated using Skype ranked the issues using Jakob Nielsen’s error severity rating scale and grouped them using affinity mapping and a spreadsheet.</p>
                    <h3>Test Objectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>1)Can participants login/sign-up with ease?</li>
                      <li>2)Are the participants able to search for plants without difficulty?</li>
                      <li>3)Can participants grasp the flow of saving a plant to the favorites list?</li>
                      <li>4)Are users able to add items to the cart and complete the checkout screens?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Test Results & Key Observations</h3>
                    <p>After gathering qualitative data, I created an affinity map and spreadsheet.
                      Having the information laid out visually in the spreadsheet allowed me to discover any patterns and focus on critical errors that had to be corrected before moving onto the next step.</p>
                    <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Users need more clarity on how to add items to the favorite list.</li>
                      <li>Additional information on the product screen would be helpful.</li>
                      <li>Adding a feature to include additional quantities of plants to a shopping cart.</li>
                      <li>A confirmation that the order went through after the checkout screen would be helpful.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Refine</h2>
                    <h3>Revisions</h3>
                    <p>After reviewing the usability test findings I moved on to refine the design of the wireframe. I made the spelling and text placement changes that users pointed out. Beyond those minor changes, I decided to change the layout of the product screen to make it more detailed and easier to use.</p>
                    <p>Changes: Added three images instead of one single image. Added a star icon to save the product as a favorite and a share icon so users can share the product. I also added a back icon so users can go back to the previous screen.
                      In addition, I added options to change planter color, the size of the plant, and the quantity to make purchasing the product easier.</p>
                    <p>Evidence: 3/5 of the users mentioned in comments more details on the product screen page would make the shopping experience more efficient. In addition, 4/5 users were confused about how to save a product to favorites.</p>

                    <h2>Final Design </h2>
                    <h3>Design Systems </h3>
                    <p>After completing the revisions from the user testing I worked on creating a design system. This design system would allow me to have a unified set of rules to follow and make sure this consistency in defining the brand. I decided to include a color palette, typography, and common UI elements, and rules for imagery and illustration used throughout the app, website, and marketing material.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Final UI Design</h3>
                    <p>Once I tested out all the usability mistakes, I started designing the final screens in Sketch. I followed a light and minimal visual style. I wanted to leave ample white space to not overwhelm the user. I also wanted to use green in more pastel shades to tie into the color most users associate with plants. I added illustrations to plant care so that information is easily accessible to users and grabs their attention.</p>

                    <h3> Mockups </h3>
                    <p>The final task of the student project was to create mockups of the mobile and website designs to present to clients in the future.
                      I focused on ensuring the main concepts of the app and the best parts of the design were visible in the mock-ups.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <h3>What have you learned from this project?</h3>
                    <p>This project really helped me enhance my UI design skillset and create a professional brand and prototype. I personally felt this project was my best project during my time at Career Foundry in terms of presentation and visual style. I was able to master Sketch and create a more refined prototype using Invision.</p>
                    <p>I struggled with the testing portion of the project and synthesizing the results. I was on a time crunch and chose users who were available on short notice but some of the participants were not really interested in the project or its functionality. This meant that I was left on my own to test the usability of the app and limited my refining of the design. In the future, I would choose from a more variant testing pool and ensure that they have enough
                      time to complete all phases of user testing.</p>
                    <p>I also struggled with the website adaptation at first and created a simple home page. I then decided to go back after completing the mockups and refined the home page and used my original home page design as a mock-up that can
                      be advertised on the Apple Store. I was proud of the second design and felt it represented my UI skillset effectively.</p>
                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>Since this was an educational project and I was on a deadline I was not able to complete all the steps I would have liked to complete.</p>
                    <p>I would expand on the website design and design all screens for the website that have been designed for the mobile app. I would also test the prototype again with the website design to see if there are usability changes that can be made to the website.</p>
                    <p>I would also choose a more random participant pool and not rely solely on participants in my social circle.</p>
